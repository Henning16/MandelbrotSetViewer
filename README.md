# MandelbrotSetViewer
A Mandelbrot Set explorer written in Java for a school math paper. No longer in active development.

It features different color maps, switching between the corresponding Julia and Mandelbrot set, smooth coloring and a fast(er) algorithm as well as a minimap.
It has various options for the zoom factor, the control parameter c, iterations, resolution and precision. Furthermore, it can output the image as a .png file (wip).
The program takes usage of the FlatLaf-IntelliJ Themes.
