# MandelbrotSetViewer
A Mandelbrot Set explorer written in Java for a math paper. It is still in development, so it might be buggy and there is no real documentation at the moment.
It features different color maps, switching between the corresponding Julia and Mandelbrot set, smooth coloring and a fast(er) algorithm as well as a minimap.
It has various options for the zoom factor, the control parameter c, iterations, resolution and precision. Furthermore, it can output the image as a .png file (wip).
The program takes usage of the FlatLaf-IntelliJ Themes.
